We've made the following changes to the stock ed25519-donna from
as of 8757bd4cd209cb032853ece0ce413f122eef212c.

 * Interfaces to match the `ref10` integration function prototypes have been
   added, and mostly replace the ed25519-donna provided ones.

   * Removed entirely (Replaced with expanded form private key code):
     * `ED25519_FN(ed25519_publickey)`
     * `ED25519_FN(ed25519_sign)`

   * Made static/file scoped:
     * `ED25519_FN(ed25519_randombytes_unsafe)`
     * `ED25519_FN(ed25519_sign_open)`
     * The various `ed25519_` typedefs.

 * There's an implementation of multiplicative key blinding so we can use
   it for next-gen hidden service descriptors.

 * There's an implementation of 'convert a curve25519 key to an
   ed25519 key' so we can do cross-certification with curve25519 keys.

 * The secret (aka private) key is now stored/used in expanded form.
