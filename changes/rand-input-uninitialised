  o Minor bugfix (security, random number generation):
    - Don't pass potentially uninitialised buffers to RAND_bytes.
      (OpenSSL uses the buffer as an entropy source, which is
      undefined behaviour on uninitialised memory.)
      Bugfix on tor 0.0.6rc4, commit f6dbe5a0d42d / svn:r1717
      on 27 Apr 2004.
      Patch by "teor".
