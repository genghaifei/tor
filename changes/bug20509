  o Directory authorities:
     - Directory authorities will now withhold the Guard flag from
       relays which are running Tor versions 0.2.9.1-alpha-dev to
       0.2.9.4-alpha-dev, and 0.3.0.0-alpha-dev. Bug 20499 causes
       these versions to not update the consensus they will serve,
       which could prevent clients that use these relays as Guards
       from being able to connect to the network. See ticket 20509.
