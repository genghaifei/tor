  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop requiring a consensus containing exits, before new nodes
      can test their ORPort reachability. Instead, allow Tor to
      create internal circuits when it receives a consensus with no exits.
      This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13814.
      Makes bug 13161's TestingDirAuthVoteExit non-essential.
