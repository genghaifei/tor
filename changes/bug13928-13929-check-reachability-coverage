  o Minor features (authorities, testing):
    - Create exhaustive unit tests that test every scale, start point, and
      permutation of authority reachability test cycles. Ensure that each
      reachability test cycle covers all digests exactly once.
      Tests 13929 and 13928. Patch by "teor".
