  o Minor bugfixes (IPv6 exit):
    - Keep client IPv6Traffic and PreferIPv6 flags, even on non-IPv6 Exits.
      This allows non-IPv6 exits to send back the address the client prefers,
      even if it is an IPv6 address resolved from an IPv6-only hostname.
      Fixes bug 21310; bugfix on commits 9016d9e829 and 2889bd2642 in
      0.2.4.7-alpha.
