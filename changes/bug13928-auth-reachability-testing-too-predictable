  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Tor authorities' reachability testing of relays is predictable,
      as it is sequential, always starts at the lowest fingerprints, and
      checks fingerprints in numeric order. This means that authorities
      that start in the same 10-second period, check the reachability
      of the same relays at the same time. (This is more of an issue
      in testing networks.)
      To fix this, each authority picks a random start point and
      sequence order when it starts reachability testing.
      This may improve the accuracy, reliability, and/or security
      of reachability testing.
      Fixes bug 13928.
