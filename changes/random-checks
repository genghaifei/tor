  o Minor bugfix (security, random number generation):
    - Handle RAND_bytes failures by trying again, then asserting.
    - Don't pass an uninitialised buffer to RAND_bytes. (OpenSSL uses
      the buffer as an entropy source, which is undefined behaviour,
      and unnecessary.)
      Fixes an unnumbered minor security bug; bugfix on tor 0.0.6rc4,
      commit f6dbe5a0d42d / svn:r1717 on 27 Apr 2004.
      Patch by "teor".
