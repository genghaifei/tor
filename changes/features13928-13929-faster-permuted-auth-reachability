  o Minor features (authorities):
    - Increase reachability testing rate when
      TestingAuthDirTimeToLearnReachability is set lower than
      the default value. Experimental feature activated by the
      DIRSERV_SCALE_REACHABILITY macro. Resolves 13929. Patch
      by "teor".

  o Minor features (authorities):
    - Randomise reachability testing start point and randomly
      permute reachability testing order. Prevents an issue where
      authorities that start at similar times, test each relay at
      similar times. (This is more of an issue in test networks.)
      Experimental feature activated by the
      DIRSERV_PERMUTE_REACHABILITY macro. Resolves 13928. Patch
      by "teor".

  o Minor features (authorities, testing):
    - Create exhaustive unit tests that ensure every scale,
      start point, and permutation, cover all digests exactly once
      each testing cycle. Tests 13929 and 13928. Patch by "teor".
