  o Major features (onion services):
    - Add experimental OnionServiceSingleHopMode and
      OnionServiceNonAnonymousMode options. When both are set to 1, every
      hidden service on a tor instance becomes a non-anonymous Single Onion
      Service. Single Onions make one-hop (direct) connections to their
      introduction and renzedvous points. One-hop circuits make Single Onion
      servers easily locatable, but clients remain location-anonymous.
      This is compatible with the existing hidden service implementation, and
      works on the current tor network without any changes to older relays or
      clients.
      Implements proposal #260, completes ticket #17178. Patch by teor & asn.
  o Minor features (onion services, circuit building):
    - Hidden services opportunistically upgrade to rend point ntor onion keys
      from relay descriptors. When the relay descriptor is not available,
      they fall back to the TAP key supplied in the INTRODUCE cell.
      Related to ticket #19163, bugfix on Tor 0.2.4.8-alpha.
  o Minor bug fixes (Tor2web):
    - Prevent Tor2web clients running hidden services, these services are
      not anonymous due to the one-hop client paths.
      Fixes bug #19678. Patch by teor.
