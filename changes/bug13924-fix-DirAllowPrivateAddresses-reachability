  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop assuming that DirAllowPrivateAddresses is 0 when checking
      reachability. Instead, if DirAllowPrivateAddresses is 1, assume
      all OR connections are remote. (This is necessary due to many test
      scenarios running all nodes on localhost.)
      This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13924.
