  o Major bug fixes (exit policies):
    - Warn if accept/reject ExitPolicy lines have an IPv6 address,
      or if accept6/reject6 ExitPolicy lines have an IPv4 address when
      parsing the torrc file. (Previously, we only warned when parsing
      descriptors.)
    - accept/reject * lines only produce IPv4 wildcard addresses,
      previously they would produce both IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard addresses.
      Closes ticket 16069. Patch by "teor".
      Patch on 2eb7eafc9d78 and a96c0affcb4c (25 Oct 2012),
      released in 0.2.4.7-alpha.
