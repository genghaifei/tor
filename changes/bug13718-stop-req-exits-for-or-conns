  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop requiring a consensus containing exits, before new nodes
      can test their ORPort reachability. Instead, allow tor to
      create internal circuits based on an internal-only consensus.
      (Minimum bandwidth weightings for guard and middle nodes
      still apply.) This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor
      network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13787. (Rarer, intermittent failures may
      still occur due to race conditions.)
      Makes bug 13161's TestingDirAuthVoteExit non-essential.
