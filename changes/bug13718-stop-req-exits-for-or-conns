  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop requiring exit dir info for new nodes to test their ORPort
      reachability. Instead, allow tor to create internal circuits
      once a minimum portion of guard and middle directory info is
      available.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13787. (Rarer, intermittent failures may
      still occur due to race conditions.)
      Makes bug 13161's TestingDirAuthVoteExit non-essential.
