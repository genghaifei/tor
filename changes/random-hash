  o Minor features (security, random number generation):
    - Hash all PRNG output before returning random bytes.
      This prevents attacks similar to the Dual EC attack at
      https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/
      Patch by "teor".
    - Throw away the first bytes returned by the PRNG. This
      defends against "startup problem" vulnerabilites as
      described in http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/06_random.pdf
      Patch by "teor".
