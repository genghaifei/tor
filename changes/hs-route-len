  o Minor features (onion services):
    - Add experimental __OnionSrvIntroRouteLength and
      __OnionSrvRendRouteLength torrc options for one-hop single onion
      services. These are backwards compatible with current hidden
      service clients. Use -1 for the default length (3), and for one-hop
      circuits:
      __OnionSrvIntroRouteLength 1
      __OnionSrvRendRouteLength 0
