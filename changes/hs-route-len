  o Minor features (onion services):
    - Add experimental __OnionSrvIntroRouteLength and
      __OnionSrvRendRouteLength torrc options for one-hop single onion
      services. Use -1 for the default length (3), and for one-hop
      circuits:
      __OnionSrvIntroRouteLength 1
      __OnionSrvRendRouteLength 0
      This is an alternate implementation of the "Stream latency is
      reduced on a 4-hop circuit" feature of #prop252. It is compatible
      with existing hidden service implementation, and works on the
      existing tor network without any changes to older relays or clients.
      Completes ticket #17178. Patch by "teor".
