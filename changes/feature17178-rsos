  o Minor features (onion services):
    - Add experimental RendezvousSingleOnionServiceNonAnonymousServer
      option. When set to 1, every hidden service instance becomes a
      non-anonymous Rendezvous Single Onion Service (RSOS). RSOSs make
      one-hop connections to their introduction and renzedvous points.
      Set to 1 for one-hop circuits, and 0 (default) for three-hop
      circuits.
      One-hop circuits make RSOS servers easily locatable, but clients
      remain location-anonymous. However, client use of a RSOS may be
      statistically distinguishable.
      This is an alternate implementation of the "Stream latency is
      reduced on a 4-hop circuit" feature of #prop252. It is compatible
      with existing hidden service implementation, and works on the
      existing tor network without any changes to older relays or
      clients.
      Completes ticket #17178. Patch by "teor".
