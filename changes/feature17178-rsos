  o Major features (onion services):
    - Add experimental SingleOnionMode and NonAnonymousMode options.
      When both are set to 1, every hidden service instance becomes a
      non-anonymous Single Onion Service. Single Onions make one-hop
      (direct) connections to their introduction and renzedvous points.
      One-hop circuits make Single Onion servers easily locatable, but
      clients remain location-anonymous.
      This is compatible with the existing hidden service
      implementation, and works on the current tor network without any
      changes to older relays or clients.
      Completes ticket #17178. Patch by teor.
    o Minor bug fixes (option parsing):
      Count unix sockets when counting client listeners (SOCKS, Trans,
      NATD, and DNS). This has no user-visible behaviour changes: these
      options are set once, and never read.
      Required for correct behaviour in ticket #17178.
